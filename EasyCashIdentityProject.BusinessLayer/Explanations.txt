In the abstract folder, we will contain our Services
In the concrte folder, we will coantain our Managers

Services and Managers huh? 

Let's take a quick look:

1. Here we will be calling the methods of each entity's own interface, which inherits from the generic interface in the data access layer, through manager classes.

2. Validations rule will be contained here. So, if request is not valid, program will not go to the database.

3. Extension methods will be written in the BLL when neccessary.
