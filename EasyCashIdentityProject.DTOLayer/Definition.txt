DTOs, or Data Transfer Objects, are like data messengers in software. You can speak among the different layers by using DTOs.
They help in talking between different parts of your app and the outside world.

So, why do we need to have this DTOs?

*******************
** Data Makeover **
*******************

Hide the Mess: DTOs clean up the way data looks when it moves around your app. 
They make sure the data inside stays private, and only the good stuff goes outside to clients.

Look Good, Feel Good: They also let you style the data to fit the client's taste. 
No unnecessary info is sent; it's like sending just the right emojis in your texts.


************************************
***** Cutting the Extra Weight *****
************************************

Slim Data Packages: DTOs are like packing only what you need for a trip. 
They cut down on the data sent over the internet, making your app faster and saving on data bills.

Smart Queries: When talking to databases, DTOs fetch only the must-haves. 
It's like asking for a coffee without listing all the beans in the store.


***********************
*** Keeping Secrets ***
***********************

Locking Away Secrets: DTOs are like secret agents. 
They hide sensitive info and only share what's safe with the clients.

No TMI: They don't spill all the beans about how things work inside. 
It's like not telling your life story to every stranger.


************************************
****** Updates without Drama *******
************************************

Change with Style: When your app's inside changes, DTOs handle it gracefully. 
Clients can keep using the old ways until they're ready for the cool new stuff.

Easygoing Evolution: DTOs let your app evolve behind the scenes without bothering the clients. 
It's like changing your outfit without asking for permission.

*****************************************
******* App Friends without Drama *******
*****************************************

Client’s Choice: DTOs let the client and server chat without knowing all the nitty-gritty details. 
The client just needs to get what the DTO is saying, not how it's all happening backstage.

Tech Diversity: Your app can speak different tech languages, like a multilingual genius. 
DTOs keep everyone on the same page, no matter their tech taste.
